M4All - Work Abandoned Busy Due to Other Endeavours

Introduction
------------
Music Apps on desktops need some serious improvements. On the top of my mind
- Better Online Streaming Service Integration
- Last FM Intergration
- Better Metadata Fetch & Autocorrect Features
- AI smart playlist, songs based on mood detection
- Lyric Fetching and Caching
- Integrated Legal Downloads
- UI & Intutiveness
- Syncing Lyrics with Music
- Consistent Interface Across Multiple Platforms

Unfortunately this huge venture would take considerable amounts of time. Something I would like to later. Electron seems a better platform than Kivy. I wasn't quite satisfied with Kivy's support for Android. Looking for a good music: Clementine an Amarok fork is currently the best out there.
